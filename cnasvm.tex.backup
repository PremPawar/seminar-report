\chapter*{ABSTRACT}
Vehicle locationing in GSM network with greater accuracy is one of the major popular
research topic of Intelligence transportation System and it goes on with the evolution
of techniques and methods which enable the data processor to learn and execute
activities with the help of Machine learning. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an
isolated classifier which deals with both linear and nonlinear data from hyper-plane
with the help of Supervised Learning technique. Wherever the Statistical Learning
Theory was unable to procure location information in a Mobile Computing because
of functional dependencies of geographic coordinates from RSSI but SVM can predict
the location fingerprint with regression estimation and linear operator inversion and
realize the actual risk minimization by structural risk minimization. SVM can deliver
a good learning outcome with the help of less sample dataset. Basically SVM is for
linearly separable samples to determine the optimal classification hyper-plane. 
The existing ANN model gives the standared deviation upto 20\%  to 22\%. The
SVM model can give the standard deviation upto 8\% to 10\% from the same dataset used 
for training as well as testing for both the models. SVM gives a very low
error rate when used for classification. SVM achieve greater accuracy in predicting the 
location information of vehicles in GSM network.

\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
The Trends of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)\index{ITS} \nomenclature{ITS}{Intelligent Transportation Systems} 
has been continuously being popular over the recent years. The researchers has been looking forward to enhance 
transportation systems with information technology and communication. To achieve better performances in terms of 
transportation duration, fuel consumption, safety, etc. To achieve the best possible route and optimize the overall 
transportation system cost, it has been needed that there should be continuous and accurate track of Vehicle. The 
ITS most oftenly depends on precise location information \cite{6}.

\section{DISSERTATION IDEATION}
Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL)\index{AVL} \nomenclature{AVL}{Automatic Vehicle Location} systems use vehicle location 
information. The system archieve the geographic location of a vehicle and acknowledge the information back to the
request originator. The AVLs are most often developed for public transportation (buses, trains, and taxies) 
and emergency (police, firefighters, and ambulance).
The AVL system can acquire a vehicle’s location information using GPS
(cna) \index(cna) \nomenclature{cna}{chetan nimba aher} or
GSM. 

Global Positioning System (GPS)\index{GPS} \nomenclature{GPS}{Global Positioning System}, has majorly use to estimate a
vehicle tracking in an AVL system. It has very good accuracy, among the other available positioning technologies.
But in the urban areas having roads surrounded by huge and narrow buildings forming a sort of urban canyon. 
Which impairs the availability of the GPS system. 

The alternatives to GPS is Global System for Mobiles (GSM).\index{GSM} \nomenclature{GSM}{Global System for Mobiles} 
Which is used for tracking the vehicle/mobile in GSM Network using the GSM Loction Information \cite{6}.

\section{MOTIVATION OF THE DISSERTATION}
Machine Learning is one of the major popular research topics of Artificial Intelligence and its relay with the evolution of
techniques and methods which enable the data processor to learn and execute activities. 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) \index{SVM} \nomenclature{SVM}{Support Vector Machine} is a segregated
classifier deal with both linear and nonlinear data from hyperplane with the help of Supervised Learning Approach. 
Whereas Statistical Learning Theory cannot procure location information in a Sentient Computing because of functional 
dependencies of geographic coordinates from RSSI \index{RSSI} \nomenclature{RSSI}{Received Signal Strength Indication}
but SVM can predict the location fingerprint with regression estimation and linear operator inversion and realize
the actual risk minimization by structural risk minimization, so that SVM can also obtain a good learning outcome in the 
face of less sample volume. The basic idea of SVM is for the linearly separable samples, to find the optimal classification 
hyperplane which can describe accurately the samples into two categories for the linearly nonseparable problems; to 
transform the linear non-separable problems in the original space into the linearly separable problems in 
high-dimensional feature space by a nonlinearly transformation for the given samples. SVM gives 
a very low error rate when used as a classifier \cite{18}.

Support Vector Machine (SVM)\index{SVM}\nomenclature{SVM}{Support Vector Machine} was first heard in 1992, 
introduced Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis in 1992 and gained increasing popularity in late 1990s. 
Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and
regression. They belong to a family of generalized linear classifiers. In another terms, Support
Vector Machine (SVM) is a classification and regression prediction tool that uses machine
learning theory to maximize predictive accuracy while automatically avoiding over-fit to the
data. Support Vector machines can be defined as systems which use hypothesis space of a
linear functions in a high dimensional feature space, trained with a learning algorithm from
optimization theory that implements a learning bias derived from statistical learning theory.
Support vector machine was initially popular with the Neural Information Processing Systems
(NIPS)\index{NIPS}\nomenclature{NIPS}{Neural Information Processing Systems} community and now is 
an active part of the machine learning research around the
world. SVM becomes famous when, using pixel maps as input; it gives accuracy comparable
to sophisticated neural networks with elaborated features in a handwriting recognition task. It
is also being used for many applications, such as hand writing analysis, face analysis and so
forth, especially for pattern classification and regression based applications. The formulation
of SVM uses the Structural Risk Minimization (SRM)\index{SRM} \nomenclature{SRM}{Structural Risk Minimization} 
principle, which has been shown to be
superior, to traditional Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM)\index{ERM} \nomenclature{ERM}{Empirical Risk Minimization}
principle, used by conventional
neural networks. SRM minimizes an upper bound on the expected risk, where as ERM
minimizes the error on the training data. It is this difference which equips SVM with a greater
ability to generalize, which is the goal in statistical learning. SVMs were developed to solve
the classification problem, but recently they have been extended to solve regression problems \cite{2}.

For more about statistical learning theory refere ANNEXURE B [\ref{Appendix B}]

\section{LITERATURE SURVEY OF THE DISSERTATION}
The methods considered are k- Nearest Neighbor (k-NN)\index{k-NN}\nomenclature{k-NN}{k- Nearest Neighbor},
support vector machines (SVM), smallest vertex polygon (SMP)\index{SMP}\nomenclature{SMP}{Smallest Vertex Polygon},
neural networks (NN), Bayes theorem (BT)\index{BT}\nomenclature{BT}{Bayes Theorem}, and Markov Chains (MC)\index{MC}\nomenclature{MC}{Markov Chains}. 
A common trait most fingerprinting methods share is that a small change in the layout of 
the environment or the position of emitter devices would require retraining the system. 
The NN and MC methods have a similar behavior are discussed together \cite{5}.
For more detailed about different positioning methods \ref{Appendix C} ANNEXURE C.
\begin{itemize}
 \item{\bf Performance of kNN on Indoor Environments}
The k-NN positioning method has a great accuracy at close range (2.4m at 50m, 1.26 at 25m), 
but it quickly deteriorates
when closing in to the target. This is due to an innate problem of the k-NN algorithm: 
similar readings (i.e. Close points) increase the probability of an estimation error. 
Even though the k-NN algorithm does not always compute position in the same way, it has a 
remarkable precision. A problem with k-NN is that greater granularity (more fingerprints) increases 
the computational needs and requires a greater training effort \cite{6}.
\item{\bf Performance of SVM on Indoor Environments}
The SVM method has a high accuracy rate although its precision can be affected by similar readings of signals
coming from different points. However, the complexity of the operations required for the positioning estimations 
demands a powerful computing infrastructure. An advantage of this method is its scalability; it is able to support 
a large amount of simultaneous targets and can be easily adapted to position resources in 3-D environments, 
because of its multidimensional approach \cite{6}.
\item{\bf Performance of SMP on Indoor Environments}
SMP calculates target positions with the help of averages,which leads to a relatively high accuracy 
in most cases, but a high precision error rate \cite{6}. This impacts SMP's score in both scalability and complexity, 
as with other fingerprinting methods.
\item{\bf Performance of NN on Indoor Environments}
NN has great accuracy at close range as 2.94m at 50m and 1.39m at 25m \cite{6}. A strong point of NN is that they have
better performance than other methods when the training database is very large, though it still requires a moderate
amount of training and computing power to carry out acceptable estimations.
\item{\bf Performance of BT and MC on Indoor Environments}
The BT and MC fingerprinting have greater accuracy at greater distances from the 
reference points, which decreases at closer distance \cite{7}. But both methods work under probability assumptions and 
their complexity is relative to the size of the coverage area and amount of targets. Sampling can be done at 
any time for the BT method, allowing the users to adjust marginal distributions of access points when a change 
invalidates the current signal calibration. A drawback of the MC method is the enormous size of its state space, 
which grows with each new state update \cite{7}.

Sampled SVM is a new data modeling method for training SVMs. Where its shown that it is fast, scalable, 
and parallelizable, yielding approximate solutions to SVM training problems. Furthermore, the method may 
use any SVM training implementation. Comparing the eight-core implementations of Sampled SVM and Cascade SVM 
demonstrates the algorithm to be faster across all four data sets. Additionally, training SVM sub problems in 
Sampled SVM is highly parallelizable. The main advantage of Sampled SVM over the Cascade SVM is the increase in the
amount of work that is parallelizable. This advantage is particularly acute when the ratio of support vectors to 
dataset size is large \cite{5}.

\subsection{Existing System}
There has been little recent and relevant research on the topic of positioning specialized 
for AVL by using the terrestrial network infrastructure. An
algorithm that estimates the speed of a mobile phone placed
in a vehicle, by correlating the time-series signal strength data
to a known signal strength trace from the same road, was
shown in \cite{9}. Results shown therein indicate a median speed
error of roughly 10 km/h. Another study \cite{10} reports a median
DE between 10 and 40 m when applying a map-matching
algorithm (more on map-matching algorithms can be found in
\cite{11}) onto a time-of-arrival positioning approach in a code-
division multiple-access system. Finally, in \cite{12}, a neural network 
was trained with the RSS GSM vector. Kalman-filtering
and map-matching features were used to form an overlaid
tracking algorithm aimed to improve initial positioning results.
After signal postprocessing, the system achieved an accuracy of
40 m with 67\% confidence (40 m | 67\%) and 95 m | 95\%. This
algorithm also requires a detailed vectored road map (needed
for the map-matching process).
More Positioning Methods are elaborated in \ref{Appendix C} ANNEXURE C.


\subsection{Proposed System}
The RSS levels (RSSI parameters) from cells are periodically
measured at the Mobile Station in idle mode and could be transferred back
to the network in the form of RI list report. 
The set of RSS values obtained at MS, will be
referred to as the reference inputs (RIs).


\begin{figure}[!h]
\captionsetup{font=scriptsize}

\centerline{\psfig{figure=./4.png,width=5in,height=2.5in}}
\caption{System Block Diagram.}
\label{fig:4}
\end{center}
\squeezeup
\end{figure}

Ideally, the MS should be served by the closest node of the
network. That would invoke the highest probability that an MS
is served by the cell with the strongest signal and
the cell with the highest RSS value was used, once the positioning request
is received, the serving location mobile center (SLMC), based
on the Cell-ID of the highest reported RSS value for each site, a
specific positioning model is applied. The model inputs (MIs)
are RSS values of a particular set of BSs The RI list is then, in SLMC,
matched with the MIs, which are specific for the area of a
particular model \cite{1}. The RI values that do not have corresponding
MIs are discarded, whereas the missing MIs are entered with
a threshold value of $ -110 dBm.$  This threshold value is the
minimal value of the RxLev parameter. On the other hand,
the maximal value of the inputs was $-47 dBm,$ which is the
maximal value of the RxLev parameter. 


The major phases in providing the location estimate are
given in figure. \ref{fig:4} where the implimented SVM model is trained and tested by the RI list
for the real time data the location coordinates were predicted.

\chapter{PROBLEM DEFINITION AND SCOPE}
A problem defination states Project Scope which defines exactly what is in the process. Processes are usually continuous 
i.e. where one process ends the other one starts immediately.

\section{PROBLEM DEFINITION}
To develope and study SVM model with the help of kernel fuction for procuring location information in available 
GSM network which will be helpful in Vehicle Tracking and Positioning with minimum distance error means, 
to predict the location coordinates in the form of $ (x, y) $ of mobile vehicle in GSM network with greater accuracy.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Received Signal Strength (Recieved Power) is inversly proportional to square of distance from Base Station
as shown in equation \ref{eq2}.
\begin{equation}
 P \propto 1/d^2
 \label{eq2}
\end{equation}
 
 \item Environmental characterization is considered with recieved power $ P_r$ where $ P_(d_0) $ is Power at 
 distance from BS as in equation \ref{eq3}.

\begin{equation}
P_r = P_(d_0) \div (d / d_0)^n
 \label{eq3}
\end{equation}
where $ 2.0 $ is the path loss component.
  \item Received Power is Calculated using the following formula \ref{eq4}.
  \begin{equation}
    P_r(d) = P_r(d_0) - 10 * n log_(10) (d/d_0)
 \label{eq4}
\end{equation}
 \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Training Procedure of SVM}
The SVM model should be trained by data set. 
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Set up the training data 
  \item Set up SVM’s parameters
   \begin{enumerate}
    \item Type of SVM.
    \item Type of SVM kernel.
    \item Termination criteria of the algorithm.
   \end{enumerate}
\item Train the SVM
\item Regions classified by the SVM
\item Support vectors
 \end{enumerate}

\section{SYSTEM ARCHITECHTURE}
The RSS levels (RSSI parameters) from cells are
periodically measured at the Mobile Station in idle mode and
could be transferred back to the network in the form of RI list
report. The set of RSS values obtained at MS will be referred to
as the reference inputs (RIs). Once the positioning request is
received, the Hosting Database Server stores all the location
fingerprints, a specific positioning model is applied. The model
inputs (MIs) are RSS values of a particular set of BSs. The RI
list is then, in Location database, matched with the MIs, which
are specific for the area of a particular model \cite{6}. Application
server where SVM model is implemented can predict the
location points. The major phases in providing the location
estimate are given in figure \ref{fig:sa}.

\end{figure}

\section{SCOPE}
SVM is powerful to approximate any training data and 
generalizes better on given datasets. The complexity in 
terms of kernel affects the performance on new datasets.  
SVM supports parameters for controlling the complexity and 
above all SVM does not tell us how to set these parameters 
and we should be able to determine these Parameters by 
Cross-Validation on the given datasets \cite{2}. The diagram 
given below gives a better illustration.

\subsection{SVM for Classification}
SVM is a useful technique for data classification. 
Even though it’s considered that Neural Networks are easier
to use than this, however, sometimes unsatisfactory results
are obtained.  A classification task usually involves with
training and testing data which consist of some data 
instances \cite{3}. Each instance in the training set contains
one target values and several attributes. The goal of SVM is 
to produce a model which predicts target value of data 
instances in the testing set which are given only the 
attributes \cite{15}.

Classification in SVM is an example of Supervised Learning. 
Known labels help indicate whether the system is performing 
in a right way or not. This information points to a desired 
response, validating the accuracy of the system, or be used 
to help the system learn to act correctly. A step in 
SVM classification involves identification as which are
intimately connected to the known classes. This is called
feature selection or feature extraction. Feature selection 
and SVM classification together have a use even when prediction
of unknown samples is not necessary. They can be used to 
identify key sets which are involved in whatever processes 
distinguish the classes \cite{15}.

\subsection{SVM for Regression}

SVMs can also be applied to regression problems by the
introduction of an alternative loss function \cite{15}. 
The loss function must be modified to include a distance 
measure. The regression can be linear and non linear.
Linear models mainly consist of the following loss functions,
e-intensive loss functions, quadratic and Huber loss function.
Similarly to classification problems, a non-linear model is
usually required to adequately model data. In the same manner
as the non-linear SVC approach, a non-linear mapping can be
used to map the data into a high dimensional feature space 
where linear regression is performed. The kernel approach is
again employed to address the curse of dimensionality. 
In the regression method there are considerations based on 
prior knowledge of the problem and the distribution of the 
noise. In the absence of such information Huber’s robust loss
function, has been shown to be a good alternative \cite{15}.

\label{fig:6}

\end{figure}

\section{PROPOSED ALGORITHM}
An algorithm is an ordered set of unambiguous, executable steps that defines a terminating process.

The step by step process for predicting Location Coordinate for the proposed system an 
algorithm \ref{alg1} is given as follows:

\begin{algorithm}[!h]
\caption{Position Prediction}
\label{alg1}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE RI List, Trained Data, SVM model 
\STATE Positioning Request
\STATE MS calculates strongest signal strenght and sends it to SLMC (Host Server) where, 
       MS calculates signal strenght for all nearest BS 
\STATE SLMC calculates distance for all RSSI values using equations \ref{eq2}, \ref{eq3} and \ref{eq4}
\STATE SLMC uses SVM model to optimize the coordinate set which satisfies all distance from given RI list
\STATE Prediction of the location (Display Position Coordinate)
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The basic prerequisite for the algorithm is trained and tested SVM Model with the training DatSet, and the
location information of the vehicle. so that the output of the system is Position of the vehicle on Google Map.

\chapter{DISSERTATION PLAN}
Planning plays an important role in successful completion of a project. This plan acts as a 
checklist of the task done. It helps in stating the amount of work to be done in a stipulated period of time. 
The time chart and can set milestones for project.
\section{PROJECT WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE (ANALYSIS)}
A work breakdown structure (WBS), in project management and systems engineering, 
is a deliverable-oriented decomposition of a project into smaller components.
\subsection{T1: Communication}
Software development process starts with the communication between stake holders.
For developing project requirement were gathered by taking into account of existing
system and by considering different scenarios.
\subsection{T2: Planning}
It included complete cost and effort estimation and scheduling various stages of development
for the Puzzle based autonomous encoding system.
\\
\subsection{T3: Modeling}
It include detailed requirement analysis for Autonomous encoding system, gathered in the communication 
stage and project design by using UML practices.

\end{figure}

\subsection{T4: Risk Management}
The objectives of risk management are to identify, analyze and give priorities to risk items 
before they become either threats to successful operation or major sources of expensive software rework, 
to establish a balanced and integrated strategy for eliminating or reducing the various sources of risk, 
and to monitor and control the execution of the strategy.\\
\hspace*{0.3in}RMMM stands for Risk, Mitigation, Monitoring and Management. The RMMM plan documents all the work 
performed as a part of risk analysis and is used by the project manager as part of the overall project plan.\\
\hspace*{0.3in}This document highlights the various risks that may be chanced upon while following the software 
development lifecycle for software development. Here highlights the risks that may affect the smooth working of the 
project development.\\

\hspace{0.3in}Major Risk types are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Project risks - Threaten the project plan, Project had to be completed within time, Reading and learning, 
requirement analysis were done simultaneously, Work had to be planned properly so that the project finished in time 
otherwise  project cost would have increased from the estimated value.
\item Technical risks - Threaten product quality and the timeliness of the schedule.
\item Known risks - Predictable from careful evaluation of current project plan and those evaluated from 
past project experience.
\item Unknown risks - Some problems simply occur regarding security.
\end{itemize}

{\bf{Risks}} & {\bf{Category}} & {\bf{Probability}} & {\bf{Impact}}\\ 
\hline 
Project does not complete on time & Project & 15\% & 3 \\ 
\hline 
Inexperience in project sowftware environment & Technical & 5\% & 2 \\

\hline

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\hspace*{0.3in}These risks are given in the table 3.1 can be monitored in the following ways to prevent their 
occurrence and thus minimize project failure.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Project does not complete on time}\\
This risk can be eliminated by the formulation of a project plan. Mainly this risk is present due to the other 
risks which are listed in table. If we could remove other risks it will automatically reduce above risk. 
This risk may be eliminated by strictly following the project plan for development.
\item {\bf Inexperience in project software environment}\\
This risk can be reduced by following all the software engineering principles. By working in a systematic and 
organized manner and planning the project according to the inputs given by the technical guide. Developer has to figure out 
the loopholes in the documentation and try and get those corrected and by planning the things in an organized manner.
\item {\bf Required resources not available}\\
This risk is due to mismanagement. It can be eliminated by properly examining the requirements and their configurations 
in advance so that required resources are available on time.
\item {\bf Lack of training on tools}\\
This is a risk that is due to inexperience of developing the software. To mitigate this risk, guidance from programmers 
with an in-depth knowledge of managing and manipulating the required tools can be taken.
\item {\bf Technology does not meet requirements}\\
In the event that the technology of database management does not allow all the features expected of it, or the 
facilities expected of the programming language are not properly supported, this risk involves more time to find 
an alternative solution to the problem. This increases the time duration of the project. This has been prevented 
by careful analysis of the system requirements and feasibility before coding starts.
\item {\bf Insufficient response for the system}\\
The response time of the system is poor because of low memory and low processing power. This risk is to be mitigated 
by building high quality software by optimizing resource usage in order to increase the performance.
\end{itemize}

\section{IMPLEMENTATION PLAN}
All the tasks in developing the system were carried out by developer. Autonomous encoding of system planned 
into following stages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Preparing Data
\item ANN Model \& SVM model
\item Calculate distance error 
\item Comparision of both the Model 
\item Android application (Real-time Data)
\item Show on Google Map
\end{enumerate}

\section{PROJECT ESTIMATION}
Project cost estimation is the process of predicting the amount of efforts required to build a Project.
It is a continuous activity which can start at the first stage of the software life cycle and continues
through the developing time.

\subsection{Estimation of KLOC:}
The no of lines required for implementation of various modules can be estimated as shown in Table 3.2.
Thus the total number of lines required is approximately 2.338 KLOC.\\

{\bf Efforts:}
\begin{table}[!h]
\begin{center}
\caption{Estimation in KLOC} 
\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c |}
\hline 
{\bf{Sr.No.}} & {\bf{Function}} & {\bf{Estimated KLOC}}\\ 
\hline 
1 & Preparing Data & 0.292 \\ 
\hline 
2 & ANN Model \& SVM model  & 0.403 \\ 
\hline 
3 & Calculate distance error & 0.136 \\ 
\hline 
4 & Comparision of both the Model & 0.509 \\ 
\hline 
5 & android application (Real-time Data) & 0.479 \\ 
\hline 
6 & Show on Google Map & 0.519 \\ 
\hline
  & {\bf Total KLOC} & {\bf2.338} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The effort taken is calculated by the formula.

$$ E = 3.2 * (KLOC)^{1.05} $$
$$ E = 3.2 * (2.338)^{1.05} $$
$$ E =  7.806146733 $$

Approximate 8 persons/month 

The development time in months is calculated by the formula:
$$ D = 2.5 * (E)^{0.38} $$
$$ D = 2.5 * (8.18)^{0.38} $$
$$ D = 5.458407546  $$

Approximate 5.5 months 

The recommended number of people is calculated by the formula:
$$ N = E/D $$
$$ N = 7.806146733/5.458407546 persons $$
$$ N = 1.430114308 $$

Approximate 2 Person 

According to recommendation of person for development and development time
consideration as number of person of development is $1,$ so it leads to increase the
development time from  5.5 months  to  11 months.

\section{PROJECT PLAN}
Scheduling of a software project does not differ greatly from scheduling of any multitask effort.
Therefore, generalized, project scheduling tools and techniques can be applied to project with little modifications. 
The project schedule provides a road map for a project manager. If it has been properly developed, the project schedule 
defines the tasks and milestones that must be tracked and controlled as the project proceed. The table \ref{tab2} shows 
planning and scheduling of the project.

\chapter{SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION}
A software requirements specification (SRS) is a requirements specification for a software system. 
It is a description of the behavior of a system which is going to developed and may include a set of use cases 
that describe interactions of the users with the software system. 

In addition it also contains non-functional requirements. SRS describe the intended purpose and environment 
for software under development. The SRS fully describes the questions below.
\begin{itemize}
 \item What the software will do? and
 \item How it will be expected to perform?.
\end{itemize}

\section{PURPOSE AND SCOPE}
The purpose of Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to describe the
external behavior of the System. Requirements Specification defines and describes the
operations, interfaces, performance, and quality assurance requirements of System. The
document also describes the non functional requirements such as the user interfaces. 
The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) captures the
complete software requirements for the system, or a portion of the system.

\subsection{Usability}
Usability requirements include any special or unique requirements that identify and define
human-factor considerations and constraints (e.g., design space limits, climatic limits, eye
movement, reach, ergonomics, cognitive limits, and usability) that affect operation of the
software.

 Enable the Location Services for the Android Application to send the Location Information to the Host Server.

 \subsection{Interfaces}
Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the application and other
hardware, software, and communication protocols.

\subsubsection{User Interface}
User interface is needed for communication between system and the user. System has attractive and be user friendly GUI 
through which any kind of user can easily Track and Locate the Vehicle in GSM Network and can generate analysis of results.

\subsubsection{Software Interface}
Software interfaces are provided with NetBeans IDE and explained in next Chapter that is ``HIGH LEVEL DESIGN DOCUMENT''.

\section{REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION}
Requirements are the desired characteristics of the software being developed. The first activity in most projects 
is the identification and documentation of the requirements. Requirements cover both requirements engineering 
(identification, analysis and capture) and requirements management (managing change, creating and maintaining agreement 
with customers, trace ability and metrics). The development of large, complex systems presents many challenges to 
systems engineers. Foremost among these is the ability to ensure that the final system satisfies the needs of 
users and provide for easy maintenance and enhancement of these systems during their deployed lifetime. These 
systems often change and evolve throughout their life cycle. This makes it difficult to track the implemented system 
against the original and evolving user requirements.

The following requirements and constraints were considered during the requirement analysis phase.

\subsection{Product Performance Requirements}
Input to the system is Tracking Request of the Vehicle meanwhile the Location Information of the Vehicle is Updated at 
Location Database of Hosting Server which is fetched at Application Server by sending a request.

The Located Position of the Vehicle should be more precised

\subsection{User Requirements}
User requires accurate results in less time. 
It should be made by optimizing the SVM model.
System should be easy to handle and effective.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
Requirements analysis is critical to the success of a systems or software project 
The requirements should be documented, actionable, measurable, testable, traceable, related to 
identified business needs or opportunities, and defined to a level of detail sufficient for system design.

The system should able to perform Encoding, Decoding, Interleaving, Deinterleaving operation for 
that we required functional requirement as Java development kit or NetBeans IDE.

\subsection{Non-functional Requirements}
The design should be user friendly, There should be a logger in order to track the activities on the Host server, 
There should be no GSM range failure for Application to work, The System user should know the Vehicle Identity \&
Internet Connectivity.

\section{ANALYSIS MODELS}
The analysis model describes the structure of the system. It provides the first technical representation of a system.
\subsection{Data Flow Diagram}
Data Flow Diagram(DFD) is also called as Bubble Chart is a graphical technique, which
is used to represent information flow, and transformer those are applied when data moves from input to output.
At the lowest level of system data flow analysis, It can see that the user will give some input to software system and 
the required data will be extracted by system.\\

Data Flow Diagrams serves two purposes: 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item to provide an indication of how data are transformed as they move through the system and
 \item to depict the functions that transform the data flow.
\end{enumerate}
  
The DFD provides additional information that is used during the analysis of the information domain and 
serves as a basis for the modeling of function. A description for each function presented in the DFD is 
contained in a process specification.\\

A DFD shows what kinds of information will be input to and output from the system,
where the data will come from and go to, and where the data will be stored. It does not show
information about the timing of processes, or information about whether processes will
operate in sequence or in parallel.

Following Figure \ref{DFD0}, is the DFD level 0 which shows the interaction between the
User and Mobile Vehicle through the system that is been implemented.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

The location data is sent from Mobile to Host Server to fetch via the proposed SVM Model, and 
by parsing the input data the system is trained. so that it could track the vehicle as shown in figure \ref{DFD1},

\chapter{HIGH LEVEL DESIGN DOCUMENT}
High-level design provides an overview of an entire system, identifying all its elements at some level of abstraction.
This chapter Disscuss the Mathematical Model, Technical Specification and UML diagrams.
\section{MATHEMATICAL MODEL}
Let $S$ be a Implimented system which Locate the Mobile in GSM Network $$S=\{I,F,O\}$$

Where,
$I$ represents the set of inputs\\
$I$ = $I1, I2, I3, I4, I5$\\
$I1$ = Radio Signal Strenght (RSS)\\
$I2$ = Mobile Country Code (MCC)\\
$I3$ = Mobile Network Code (MNC)\\
$I4$ = Location Area Code (LAC)\\
$I4$ = Cell\_id \\

And $F$ is the set of function uses kernel trick to classification\\
$F$ = $F1, F2, F3,$\\
$F1$ = Create SVM\\
$F2$ = Train SVM\\
$F3$ = Test SVM\\

And $O$ is the set of outputs shows the Location\\
$O$ = $O1,O2$\\
$O1$ = Longitute\\
$O2$ = Latitude\\

\section{TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION}
In this section different technologies used for implimentation of the system are disscussed.
\subsection{Java Technology}
Java technology is both a programming language and a platform.
The Java programming language is a high-level language that can be characterized by all of the following buzzwords: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Simple
\item Architecture neutral
\item Object oriented
\item Portable
\item Distributed	
\item High performance
\item Interpreted	
\item Multithreaded
\item Robust
\item Dynamic
\item Secure
\end{itemize}	

With most programming languages, developer either compile or interpret a program so that he/she can 
run it on his/her computer. The Java programming language is unusual in that a program is both compiled and
interpreted. With the compiler, first developer translate a program into an intermediate language called Java
byte codes the platform-independent codes interpreted by the interpreter on the Java platform. 
The interpreter parses and runs each Java byte code instruction on the computer. Compilation happens 
just once; interpretation occurs each time the program is executed.\\

Developer can think of Java byte codes as the machine code instructions for the 
Java Virtual Machine (Java VM). Every Java interpreter, whether it’s a development tool or
a Web browser that can run applets, is an implementation of the Java VM. Java byte codes help 
make “write once, run anywhere” possible. Developer can compile program into byte codes on any platform 
that has a Java compiler. The byte codes can then be run on any implementation of the Java VM. 

The Java platform has two components: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The Java Virtual Machine (Java VM) 
\item The Java Application Programming Interface (Java API) 
\end{itemize}

Java VM is the base for the Java platform and 
is ported onto various hardware-based platforms. The Java API is a large collection of ready-made software 
components that provides many useful capabilities, such as graphical user interface (GUI) widgets. The Java
API is grouped into libraries of related classes and interfaces; these libraries are known as packages. \\

Native code is code that after developer compile it, the compiled code runs on a specific hardware 
platform. As a platform-independent environment, the Java platform can be a bit slower than native code.
However, smart compilers, well-tuned interpreters, and just-in-time byte code compilers can bring
performance close to that of native code without threatening portability. \\

Every full implementation of the Java platform gives the following features: 

\begin{itemize}
\item The essentials: Objects, strings, threads, numbers, input and output, data structures, system properties, 
date and time, and so on. 
\item Applets: The set of conventions used by applets. 
\item Networking: URLs, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Data gram Protocol) sockets, and IP
(Internet Protocol) addresses. 
\item Internationalization: Help for writing programs that can be localized for users worldwide. Programs can
automatically adapt to specific locales and be displayed in the appropriate language. 
\item Security: Both low level and high level, including electronic signatures, public and private key management, 
access control, and certificates. 
\item Software components: Known as JavaBeansTM, can plug into existing component architectures. 
\item Object serialization: Allows lightweight persistence and communication via Remote Method Invocation (RMI). 
\item Java Database Connectivity (JDBCTM): Provides uniform access to a wide range of relational databases. 
\end{itemize}

The Java platform also has APIs for 2D and 3D graphics, accessibility, servers, collaboration, telephony, 
speech, animation, and more. 

\subsection{Advanced Technology Used}

\begin{enumerate}
{\bf \item Encog} 
is an advanced machine learning framework that supports a variety of advanced algorithm, 
as well as support classes to normalize and process data. Machine learning algorithm such as Support Vector Machines,
Artificial Neural Networks, Genetic Programming, Bayesian Networks, Hidden Markov Models and Genetic Algorithm are 
supported. Most Encog training algorithm are multi-threaded and scale well to multicore hardware. Encog can also make
use of a GPU to further speed processing time. A GUI based workbench is also provided to help model and train machine
learning algorithms. Encog has been in active development since 2008.

{\bf \item jsoup} is a Java library for working with real-world HTML. It provides a very convenient 
API for extracting and manipulating data, using the best of DOM, CSS, and jquery-like methods.
jsoup implements the WHATWG HTML5 specification, and parses HTML to the same DOM as modern browsers do.
\begin{itemize}
 \item scrape and parse HTML from a URL, file, or string 
 \item find and extract data, using DOM traversal or CSS selectors
 \item manipulate the HTML elements, attributes, and text
 \item clean user-submitted content against a safe white-list, to prevent XSS attacks
 \item output tidy HTML
\end{itemize}
jsoup is designed to deal with all varieties of HTML found in the wild; from pristine and validating, to 
invalid tag-soup; jsoup will create a sensible parse tree.

{\bf \item TelephonyManager}Provides access to information about the telephony services on the device. 
Applications can use the methods in this class to determine telephony services and states, as well as to access 
some types of subscriber information. Applications can also register a listener to receive notification of telephony
state changes.

Developer do not instantiate this class directly; instead of retrieving a reference to an instance through

Context\.getSystemService(Context\.TELEPHONY\_SERVICE)

Access to some telephony information is permission-protected. 
Application cannot access the protected information unless it has the appropriate permissions 
declared in its manifest file. Where permissions apply, they are noted in the the methods through 
which access the protected information. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{UML DIAGRAMS}

UML stands for Unified Modeling Language which is used in object oriented software engineering. 
UML is designed to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.

\subsection{Use Case Diagram}
The use case view models functionality of the system as perceived by outside user. Use case 
is a coherent unit of functionality expressed as a transaction among actors and a system. Use Case Diagrams 
are useful for modeling the dynamic aspects of the systems. Use case diagrams are central to modeling the 
behavior of the system, a subsystem or a class. They show a set of use cases and actors and their relationships. 
Use Case Diagrams commonly contain the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Use cases.
\item Actors.
\item Dependency, generalization, and association relationships.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Class Diagram}
The class diagram is the main building block of object oriented modeling. It is used both for 
general conceptual modeling of the systematic of the application, and for detailed modeling translating the 
models into programming code. Class diagrams can also be used for data modeling. The classes in a class diagram 
represent both the main objects, interactions in the application and the classes to be programmed.

\subsection{Sequence Diagram}
A sequence diagram is graphical view of a scenario that shows object interaction in time based 
sequence. What happens first, what happens next sequence diagram establish the roles of object and help provide 
essential information to determine class responsibilities and interface.

\chapter{TEST SPECIFICATION}
A summary of what scenarios will be tested, 
how they will be tested, 
how often they will be tested, 
and so on.
\section{INTRODUCTION}
Testing is an important phase in the Software Development Life Cycle. Testing should be planned 
and conducted systematically.\\
Generic aspects of a test strategy
\begin{itemize}
\item Testing begins at the module level and works outwards.
\item Different testing techniques are used at different points of time.
\item Testing is done by developers and mainly for larger projects, by an independent test group.
\item Testing and debugging are two different activities, but debugging should be incorporated into any testing strategy.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Unit Testing}
It involves testing the minimum functionality of the smallest unit of software design – the modules. 
Using the design specification documentation as the guide, important control paths are tested to uncover errors
within the boundary of the module. This module level testing involves heavy use of white box testing techniques. 
Specific paths are exercised in the modules control structures for complete coverage and maximum error detection. 
This testing can be conducted in parallel for multiple modules.
\subsection{Integrated Testing}
Integration testing is a systematic technique for constructing the program structure while conducting 
tests to uncover errors associated with interfacing. The objective is to take unit tested module and build a program 
structure that has been dictated by design.
It involves testing functionality of the modules with respect to the other modules, with which the
module is supposed to interact. There is heavy use of black box testing techniques and some use of white box testing 
techniques to ensure coverage of major control paths .
\subsection{Black Box Testing}
Black box testing focuses on the functional requirements of the software. That is, black box testing 
enables the software engineer to derive sets of input conditions that will fully exercise all functional requirements 
for a program. Black box testing is not an alternative to white box testing techniques; rather it is a complementary
approach that is likely to uncover a different class of errors than white box methods. Black box testing attempts 
to find errors in the following categories.
\begin{itemize}
\item Incorrect or missing functions.
\item Interface errors.
\item Errors in data structures or external database access.
\item Performance errors.
\item Initialization and termination errors
Black box testing purposely disregards control structure, attention is focused on the information domain.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{White Box Testing}
Using white box testing methods, the software engineer can derive test cases that can Guarantee that 
all dependent paths within a module have been exercised at least once.
\begin{itemize}
\item Exercise all logical decisions on their true and false sides.
\item Execute all loops at their boundaries and within their operational bounds
\item Exercise internal data structures to assure their validity.
\end{itemize}
Here used a Black Box Testing. It is also called behavioral testing which focuses on functional 
requirements of the software. In this testing the software is tested as a black box without considering its internal
details. Required sets of input were supplied and the desired outputs are obtained.

\section{TEST CASES}

The GUI and click button's validation resutls are tested as shown in following table.
Different test case are generated in following table \ref{testt}.

where the xml data is parse into the required input parameters and then The Classifier model is trained 
for training normalized values of input parameters are used.
Normalization is done by the following \ref{eq7}
\begin{equation}
Normalize (x)=(x-Min(x))\div(Max(x)-Min(x))

\section{GRAPHICAL RESULT}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Comparision of ANN and SVM shown in Figure \ref{chart1}
 in this graph black line shows the ideal distance which is calculated by the standard formula applied in GSM network
 \ref{eq8} while the red line shows the distance obtain by SVM model and the Blue Line shows the Distance by ANN model.
\begin{equation}
 distance = [10^{((27.55 - (20 * log10(frequency)) - signalLevel)/20)}]
\label{eq8}
 \end{equation}
 
Here, the Comparision shows that the SVM line is very close to the IDEAL Distance line than the ANN line which shows the SVM 
achieving the more accuracy than the ANN.

\chapter{CONCLUSION}
Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbor, Neural Networks, Decision Tree, and many others are 
Supervised learning algorithms which are used to solve supervised learning problem. 
But what makes SVM interesting is the ability to classify complex problems having
linearly non separable cases with nonlinear decision boundary and its ability to find the optimum nonlinear
decision boundary. Using SVM system model will not get any arbitrary nonlinear decision boundary to separate 
the classes in the training data set. 

In fact, SVM algorithm will give the optimum linear separation in high dimensional feature space that will be the 
equivalent to the optimum non-linear decision boundary in the original data set. SVM has some major features such as
convexity, duality, kernels, and sparseness used in Machine Learning. The Support Vector Machine algorithm
displays a very low error rate when used for regression (spatial localization). 

The SVM based model could be designed such a way that it will procure location information in a GSM Network. 
Performance of SVM is fully depends on Kernel functions. The standared deviation Calculated for SVM classifier
is 8\% which is lower than the standared deviation Calculated for ANN that is 20\%.

In future a technique for choosing and developing a Kernel Function and monolithic control system for
predicating data from small training data sets has great scope.

\chapter{FUTURE ENHANCEMENT}
The future option for this Disssertation is to use an Enhanced Extreme Learning Machine in the Intelligent 
Transportation System. 

The Use of Support Vector Machine would provide even better results horeover the training time and the accuracy of the 
system would also be improved by using Kernel Trick.

In addition to SVM, algorithms like k-NN, k-means etc can also be used to overcome the limitation of this project for 
more precise and accurate classification. 

For Mutlti-class classification using SVM a new approach could be provided and continuous Tracking and monitoring of the 
Vehicle in GSM network will be possible to provide Location Based Services.

\chapter*{ANNEXURE B: STATISTICAL LEARNING THEORY}
\label{Appendix B}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Statistical Learning Theory 
\end{itemize}
The statistical learning theory provides a framework for studying the problem of gaining
knowledge, making predictions, making decisions from a set of data. In simple terms, it
enables the choosing of the hyper plane space such a way that it closely represents the
underlying function in the target space.
In statistical learning theory the problem of supervised learning is formulated as follows.
We are given a set of training data $ {(x1,y1) \ldots (x1,y1)}  $ in $ R^n \times R $   
sampled according to unknown probability distribution $ P(x,y),$ and a loss function $ V(y,f(x)) $
that measures the error, for a given $ x, f(x) $ is ``predicted'' instead of the actual value $ y. $
The problem consists in finding a function $ f $ that minimizes the expectation of the error on new data that is, 
finding a function $ f $ that minimizes the expected error: 
\begin{equation}
 \int V(y, f(x)) P(x, y) dx dy
\end{equation}

In statistical modeling we would choose a model from the hypothesis space, which is
closest (with respect to some error measure) to the underlying function in the target space.
More on statistical learning theory can be found on introduction to statistical learning theory

\begin{itemize}
 \item Learning and Generalization 
\end{itemize}
Early machine learning algorithms aimed to learn representations of simple functions. 
Hence, the goal of learning was to output a hypothesis that performed the correct classification 
of the training data and early learning algorithms were designed to find such an accurate fit to 
the data. The ability of a hypothesis to correctly classify data not in the training set is 
known as its generalization. SVM performs better in term of not over generalization when the neural 
networks might end up over generalizing easily. Another thing to observe is to find where to make 
the best trade-off in trading complexity with the number of epochs; the illustration brings to light more 
information about this.

\chapter*{ANNEXURE C: POSITIONING TECHNIQUES}
\label{Appendix C}
\begin{itemize}
\item GPS Based Positioning
\end{itemize}
Since the introduction of the GPS, researchers have tended
to focus on its use for AVL systems, often with little or no
regards to its limitations. Recent research studies have usually
attempted lane-level positioning. In \cite{6}, an interesting method
of acquiring digital road maps from aerial imagery was illustrated. 
Using differential GPS (DGPS) with the obtained precise
digital road maps and a map-matching algorithm produced a
lane-level AVL that is capable of correct lane estimation 97\%
of the time. Another approach to lane recognition integrates the
use of GPS and INS with the vision technologies \cite{6}. However,
the benefits of using lane-level AVL systems in terms of fleet
management, such as detecting that a vehicle has pulled off to
the shoulder or the dwell time of a bus when it has pulled into
a specific bus stop, are arguable. That is, most of these situations 
can be successfully detected by using only the position
(excluding the lane information) and speed information, adequate digital road map 
(e.g., containing bus stops as points of interest), and proper detection algorithms. Moreover, lane-level
AVL systems require more precise digital road maps, whose
production may be tedious and expensive on a large scale.

\begin{itemize}
 \item GSM Based Positioning
\end{itemize}
GPS service can become unavailable due to a number of
reasons. On the other hand, given that GSM is the most
widely deployed PLMN and that most of the modern AVL
systems already employ PLMN packet services (i.e., GPRS in
case of GSM) for fleet-tracking information \cite{6}, developing
a GSM positioning and AVL system makes additional sense.
General positioning in PLMN, without special emphasis on
AVL application, has been the focus of many research papers.
The most basic GSM-based techniques are founded on serving
cell identification (Cell-ID). This way, the mobile station
(MS) can be located with the accuracy given by the cell radius.
Bearing in mind that the cell radius may be up to 35 km, it
becomes obvious that this technique does not grant preferable
accuracy. On the other hand, it is considered to be the simplest
technique within GSM-based positioning systems. Various non-
standardized augmentations to this plain technique have been
made. Adaptive enhanced Cell-ID is a self-learning method that
uses GPS or other precise position estimates when available,
together with fingerprinting radio measurements, to populate
the fingerprinting database. The method can combine Cell-ID
with other information such as RSS and timing measurements.
This approach has yielded a 20\% - 50\% reduction in the size
of the area where the user equipment is located with respect
to basic Cell-ID positioning techniques. In \cite{ref15}, this method’s
field results are reported.

Most of the other positioning algorithms enrich the Cell-ID
information only with RSS measurements. Simulation results
using statistical modeling of RSS achieved an accuracy
of 320 m | 67\%, which is 70\% - 75\% better than the basic
Cell-ID technique’s accuracy. Although this technique does not
require field measurements to be taken, it requires knowledge
of such data as base station positions, transmitted powers, and
antenna directions in return. Genetic algorithms were employed
in the urban environment with UMTS network coverage \cite{6},
resulting in an accuracy of 450 m | 72\%. Other work, using the
database correlation algorithm and the fingerprint database constructed 
from the radio coverage prediction tool, achieved
an accuracy of 483 m | 67\% in the residential environment. The
system model uses a well-known nearest neighbor algorithm with the
following metric:
\begin{equation}
 d(k)=\sum_{i} (f_{i}-g_{i}(k))^2 + p(k)
 \end{equation}
where $f_i$ is the RSS measured by the MS on the $i^{th}$ channel,
$g_i (k)$ is the signal strength of the $k^{th}$ database fingerprint on
the same channel, i refers to the number of channels, and $p(k)$
is the penalty term to account for the differences in radio visible
base stations. We have used this algorithm on our database
populated with field measurements (instead of the predictions)
and compared the obtained results against the determined models.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Hybrid Positioning 
\end{itemize}
Although without the specific AVL application, a kindred
approach to the herein proposed positioning solution has been
investigated in, several ANN, database correlation, and hybrid algorithms using
the field-measured RSS as inputs. The ANNs were tested in
both the classifier (area estimation) and regression (position
estimation) configuration. However, the best results of roughly
140 m | 67\% were achieved by using the hybrid database
correlation and ANN approach. In, it is claimed that
the extended Kalman filter (EKF)\index{EKF}\nomenclature{EKF}{Extended Kalman Filter} yields better performances
for ANN training than the commonly used gradient descent
schemes. Using the RSS inputs to their model, they have
achieved DEs in the range of 55–70 m with low DE variance.
Being that this algorithm has the best accuracy verified with the
actual field measurements, This was applied our field measurements and compared it to the models determined in this system.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Timing Advance
\end{itemize}
Another course in PLMN positioning uses timing parameters, 
such as timing advance (TA)\label{TA}\nomenclature{TA}{Timing Advance} parameter in GSM or round-
trip time (RTT) and Rx–Tx observed time difference in UMTS. 
It should be noted that these parameters can only estimate
the distance between the mobile terminal and the serving base
station (or Node B in case of UMTS). Usually, no more than
one timing parameter can be obtained (belonging to the serving
base station). Only in the case when there are more than two
base stations in the active set (i.e., Nodes B involved in a
soft handover procedure) a location estimate can be procured
through the process of multilateration by using the timing
parameters. Being that this is only occasionally the case in
UMTS and totally impossible with standardized signaling of
TA parameter in GSM, timing information by itself is generally
insufficient for precise positioning, and it is necessary to use
some other location-dependent information such as RSS parameters. 
Moreover, the RTT parameter is not available in all
UMTS networks.

In a simulated urban environment, the database correlation 
method using RTT and power delay profile yielded a
25 m | 67\% accuracy. A similar accuracy, again in an urban
environment, was simulated in, where a novel selection
criterion was used to choose the three optimal RTT values
(under nonline-of-sight conditions) for subsequent trilateration.
Nevertheless, none of the studies involving real measurements
endorse such superb accuracy. Field tests, in urban and residential areas, 
using multiple TA values resulted in an accuracy
of up to 105 m | 67\%. However, the algorithm proposed therein
cannot be implemented using standardized GSM signaling.
